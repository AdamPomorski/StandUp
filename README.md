StandUp is a project focused on measuring seat occupancy. It was designed to be used by elderly people to notify them about ther time spent on the seat. It was created by Adam Pomorski, Micha≈Ç Ciesielski and Julia Dasiewicz on PBL4 classes (spring 2022) as a part of the Internet of Things studies at the Warsaw University of Technology.
